# Programming Your Pi Pico

By Dr. Scott Feister

Updated March 2, 2025

In this guide, I will go through how to program your Pi Pico to turn it into a MIDI instrument.

## Write Python and Troubleshoot Your Instrument

##### Parts needed:

* Pi Pico

* Your fully constructed circuits, wired into the Pi Pico

* Already-built Synthesizer

##### At the end of this section you should:

* Have a working light instrument!

##### Instructions

While I won't spell out the details here, this is where you write your Python code that runs your instrument! For example, you could use the example of the six-string/four-chord-button guitar in the twang repository: "examples/guitar.py".

Start with one of the example files like "harp.py", then copy it somewhere else, rename it, and edit it to make your own instrument.

When you feel great about everything, it's time to reboot and test. Unplug and replug your Pi Pico, and wait for the lasers to turn on. Is everything working as an instrument should? If not, talk with your teacher for more help troubleshooting.
